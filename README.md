# impactchartdemo

This repo demonstrates how to generate impact charts quickly and easily. You can read
about impact charts in 
[Impact Charts: A Tool for Identifying Systematic Bias in Social Systems and Data ](https://datapinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/impactcharts.pdf).

## Running in a local virtual environment

To run the demo in your own virtual environment, try this:

```python
pip install impactchartdemo
```

```python
jupyter-lab &
```

This should fire up the jupyter lab server and open a brownser tap to it. From there, you can open `Housing Values.ipynb`
and take it from there.

## Running in a hosted environment
